State of NC
- Carve out - Aetna Medical / CSV Provider
- Carve out to CVS
- Aetna is the pharmacy
- When it is carve out
- If the provider signs an attestation
- We still provide the link
- We provide a link to CVS Caremark
- Consolidated claim service
- In the claim service, for carved out service it 
- Starts at CVS and goes through ACAS / Processed through Aetna system
- When it is carved out, they come they come through the consolidated claims service
- The get it through the CVS API
- That is using CVS logiv
- Their logic has different eff date
- We are showing prescription claims
- We should only be showing prescription claims for the period where we are matching their 
- The key piece of this, is how do we do it so that we are not displaying any claim information for anything 
- We are already sayingn that we get the claims
- For prescription claims we are date of service.
- If there coverage date is 1/1 we we do nto show any fill before the spresecription date
- Jenn date for prescription membership matching the plan date
- Prescription matches PLAN date.
- Attestation - We just need to have CVS Carve out flag is true
- The CVS consolidated claim service only pertains to consolidated claims service
- None of other services manage any capablity other than CVS
- Refill information, order status, prescription list other information...do we display
- Does this logic have to be applied across all APIs that 
- CVS Consolidated Claims service and the prescription list
- Look at all of the APIs
