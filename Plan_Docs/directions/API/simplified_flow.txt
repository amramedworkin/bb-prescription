1. User send Auth Header and id_token to APIc 03 GW ReST service /sa/plandocs/v1/list

2. APIc 03 GW extracts EIE Headers from id_token

3. /sa/plandocs/v1/list on APIc 03 GW passes request to /sa/plandocs/v1/list on CVS BFF\

4. /sa/plandocs/v1/list on CVS BFF orchestrates the following
4.a. Checks if the user in EIE header eieheaderusercontext has cached plandocs in SuperApp plangroup cache
4.a.1. If they do, skip to 5
4.b. Calls /v3/plangroups on Plan Groups service
4.b.1. Returns the plangroups data
4.b.2. Calls for CVSSuperApp flag enabled on /v2/features service (MultiMembershipFeatures) on MMF Service
4.b.3. Filters out any plans in plangroups without CVSSuperApp flag on
4.b.4. Caches the plangroups to SuperApp plangroup cache

5. /sa/plandocs/v1/list on CVS BFF now loops through all plangroups finding those with 
5.a. Filter is ActivelyCovered
5.b. Policies aer Dental or Medical
5.c. Excludes groups with certain plan sponsor IDS (955,988)

6. Filtered membershipresourceids are then sent for lookup at /v1/plan-document-list/retrieve in the Plan Docs Service
6.a. These requests are run in parallel

7. Results are then aggregated into the /sa/plandocs array format
7.a. If any of the results have readHealthPoliciesCommnicationContentsResponse.readCommunicationContents.reasonCode = "HHL Not Signed" then return an empty array for this membershipResourceId with the readCommunicationResponse passed in the array
7.b. Otherwise add the results to the response array 

8. When all parallel requests are complete, return the constructed array to the user through the same pipelien it was sent in
