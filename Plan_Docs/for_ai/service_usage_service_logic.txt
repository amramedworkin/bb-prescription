1. CVS SuperApp sends a POST to /sa/serviceusage/v1 request to APIGW with the member's JWT
1.a. JWT is defined in /Users/n091733/Projects/bb-prescription/Plan_Docs/for_ai/json/id_token_jwt.json

2.b. Validates the JWT

2.c. APIc GW transform the JWT to EIE headers.
2.c.1. EIE headers are definded in /Users/n091733/Projects/bb-prescription/Plan_Docs/for_ai/json/eie_headers_extracted_from_jwt.txt

2.d Call the Common superapp initialization
2.d.1. Call plangroups with the EIE headers set


4. Needs to get the plan group to get the plan groups with the following parameters lineOfBusiness=Commercial for MVP.
5. CVS BFF filters down the response to one plan group based on a given shared requirement for the super app. 

5. From the PlanGroups response CVS-BFF will filter groups:
5.a. Excludes groups with certain plan sponsor IDs (955, 988). 
5.b. Filter for Actively Covered
5.c. Further filters for policies with a primary type of "Dental" or "Medical".

6. `CVS-BFF`  dispatches a post request to MMF v2/features API to check if ["DenServiceLimits", "MedServiceLimits"] are enabled.

6.a. Include parameters: 
{
  "memberships": [
  {
    membershipResourceId: "5~185762462+10+1+20220101+789436+A+1",
    features: [ "DenServiceLimits", "MedServiceLimits"],
    enabledOnly: true,
  },
  {
    membershipResourceId: "5~185762462+10+2+20220101+789436+B+2",
    features: ["DenServiceLimits","MedServiceLimits"],
    enabledOnly: true,
  },
  ]    
}
6.b. The response includes enabled features. Ensure the enabled flag is set to truefor each feature. 
6.c. If none is enabled CVS-BFF returns an empty response status code: 204 No content || 200 OK
6.d. If either of the features is enabled, CVS-BFF makes requests for Medical and Dental plan limits as described below:

7. If MedServiceLimits is enabled we request plan limits for Medical and Dental.
7.a. If DenServiceLimits is enabled we request plan limits for Dental. 
7.b. CVS-BFF (potentially after checking its cache for recent data) prepare the response object by making parallel calls to:
7.c. The accumlators service to retrieves the service usage for Medical and Dental
7.d. Call member service v1/memberships to get  demographic information for the current member. If the current member is the subscriber the, service call will include dependents.
7.e. These calls MUST be dispatched in parallel.  

8. CVS-BFF 
8.a. Receives responses, transforms and constructs  the json array 
"planServices": [{}] where each item includes the information about the service usage.
8.b. Setâ€™s the cache with the appropriate key and TT
8.c. Returns the consolidated data to the API Gateway.
8.d. Adds information in case of partial response under the additionalInformation key. See Shared Docs
8.e. Set the cache as described in the CVS-BFF shared Document. 

9. API Gateway sends the final planServices response back to the CVS Super App.
