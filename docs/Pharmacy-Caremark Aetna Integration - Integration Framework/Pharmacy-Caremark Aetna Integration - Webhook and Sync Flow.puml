:Generate Webhook Payload
(event_id, block_id, version);
:Sign Payload with HMAC-SHA256;
:Send POST to Consumer's

|Service Consumer|
:Receive Webhook POST;
:Validate HMAC Signature;
if (Signature is valid?) then (yes)

  :Discard request;
  :Log security warning;
  stop
endif

|Consumer Async Worker|
start

:Check event_id against
local cache to prevent duplicates;
if (Is new event?) then (yes)
  :Log event_id;
  :Make GET request to Provider API
  (e.g., /api/v1/ux-blocks/{block_id});
  |Service Provider|
  :Receive GET request;
  :Return latest data block;
  |Consumer Async Worker|
  :Receive data block;
  :Update local database/cache
  with new data;
  :Processing Complete;
else (no)
  :Discard duplicate event;

|Consumer Reconciliation Job (Daily)|
start
:Make GET request to
/api/v1/ux-blocks/versions-digest;
|Service Provider|
:Return list of all
block_ids and version hashes;
|Consumer Reconciliation Job (Daily)|
:Receive version digest;
:Compare with local state;
if (Discrepancies found?) then (yes)
  :For each mismatched block,
