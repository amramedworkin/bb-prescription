1. In a scenario where we only have one PDF, tapping on plan document will show them the pdf

2. Same chrome as other place for this scenario

3. In a scendario where we have multiple plan documents, we will need a list of the various documents, with some document description, if not it won't show
3.1. Then the user can click on the doc and show it
3.2. The plan comnes with various options: share, print, etc.
3.3. Assume all will be PDF
3.4. If not PDF, we will need another template
3.5. Very rare that there is only one plan document
3.6. Caremark has this scenario but Aetna really doesn't
3.7. Scenario where there are zero documents
3.8. Prepare for the search capability
3.9. We are not building towards search yet.
3.10. Aetna currently has a search in web, brining into the app next PI
3.11. They are not seeing any functionality currently in the app
3.12. Do not want to degrade performanc=e
3.13. Scope is to access just the plan doc, no other features.
3.14. May need to make this a page, not a sheet.
3.15. Documentation needs to be consistent between Aetna and CVS
3.16. There is definitely is a language component for this as well.
3.16.1. We show language in parenthesis in the app
3.16.2. Do we need to include the language components
3.16.3. Is this document name created: concat language to doc name
3.16.4. We need to keep this in mind and give some attribute to filter them out.
3.16.5. Future: Here is the doc in your native language
3.16.6. Raise this as how might we question
3.17. I need to get with them on what the json should look like if there is one or zero docs
3.18. Plan doc search in scope for SuperApp?  Not something we have solved yet.  Lots of discussion of when and how.
3.18.1. Prototype bas search
3.18.2. Not in scope for this iteration
3.18.3. But is on the radar.
3.19. For plan documents, we don't have a description
3.19.1. They will not display the field
3.20. Same with the plan name
