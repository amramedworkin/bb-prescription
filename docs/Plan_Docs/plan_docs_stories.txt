1. Foundational & Strategic Stories
These stories define the high-level goals and scope of the initiative.

Initiative (multiple epics) 

Story: Enable OpenPlatform users to access their plan documents by creating a new BFF, integrating with existing backend services, and providing a resilient, performant user experience. 

Theme: A strategic driver that groups related work. 

Story: Enhance User Experience by providing users with seamless and fast access to their essential plan documents. 

Story: Increase Development Velocity by reusing proven, existing architecture and services to reduce initial development time and risk. 

Epic (multiple stories) 

Story: Implement plan document access for OpenPlatform by building a dedicated Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) that routes list and PDF retrieval requests to existing AWS services. 

2. Architectural & Technical Enablement Stories

Architectural Runway Story (tech infra) 

Story: Establish the new OpenPlatform BFF as a deployable microservice within the AWS platform, leveraging existing CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code practices. 

Enabler Story (Exploration/Spike-Time Boxed) 

Story: Spike: Analyze architectural options for fetching plan documents, including adapting the existing on-demand architecture, pre-fetching at app startup, and a BFF-centric hybrid model, to determine the optimal approach for balancing performance and complexity. 

Enabler Story (Infrastructure) 

Story: Configure the necessary routing, permissions, and service integrations within the AWS ecosystem to allow the new OpenPlatform BFF to communicate with the existing backend Benefits Service and Features API. 

Enabler Story (Compliance/Security) 

Story: Conduct a security review of the new OpenPlatform BFF, validating its authentication/authorization mechanisms, rate limiting, data encryption, and access controls to ensure it is a secure entry point into the AWS ecosystem. 

3. Migration & Integration Stories (new-to-existing connections)

Integration Story (component connx)

Story: As the OpenPlatform BFF, I want to integrate with the existing Benefits Service by calling its /plan-document-list/retrieve endpoint to fetch a user's document list. 

Strangler Fig Pattern Story (replace old system)

Story: Implement a new route for Plan Document requests within the OpenPlatform ecosystem that directs all client traffic through the new OpenPlatform BFF instead of any existing path. 

Note: No Data Migration Stories

4. User-Facing & Functional Stories (common)
These are the traditional stories that deliver direct value to the end-user. 

Feature-Driven Story (multiple stories)

Feature: OpenPlatform - Plan Documents Access. 

Standard User Story (Frontend)

Story: As an OpenPlatform user, when I navigate to the Plan Documents section and there are multiple plan documents available, I want to see a list of documents with their names so I can choose which one to view. 

Story: As an OpenPlatform user, if my plan requires a signed Hold Harmless Letter and it's not signed, I want to see a clear message explaining this, instead of an empty document list. 

Standard User Story (Backend):

Story: As an OpenPlatform BFF, I want to retrieve a specific plan document PDF by its documentId so that I can deliver it to the OpenPlatform client. 

5. Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) Stories (new arch meets required quality)

Performance Story:

Story: As the Benefits Service, I want to use Redis to cache plan document lists for one hour so that I can reduce load on core APIs and improve response times for the OpenPlatform BFF. 

Story: The new BFF endpoints must adhere to the existing backend rate limits of 950/min for the list endpoint and 2333/min for the PDF endpoint to ensure system stability. 

Scalability Story:

Story: The Plan Documents feature must be horizontally scalable to handle anticipated growth in OpenPlatform user traffic by leveraging existing scalable AWS services (API Gateway, Lambda, S3). 

Reliability/Availability Story:

Story: The OpenPlatform BFF must gracefully handle API error responses (e.g., 4xx, 5xx) from the downstream Benefits Service by propagating appropriate error codes and user-friendly messages to the client. 

Usability Story:

Story: As an OpenPlatform user, I want the plan document viewing experience to be consistent in design and behavior with other document views in the app, so I have a seamless user experience. 

6. Operational & Maintenance Stories (health/maintainability)

Tooling and Automation Story:

Story: Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting for the new OpenPlatform BFF to provide visibility into its performance, errors, and traffic patterns via existing APM tools. 

Documentation Story:

Story: Create and publish a formal OpenAPI (YAML) specification for the new OpenPlatform BFF endpoints, including detailed schemas and examples for the request and response models. 

Technical Debt Story:

Story: To mitigate data gaps from upstream services, a limited data augmentation capability will be built into the BFF, while deferring the complexity of a full BFF-side caching solution to a future iteration.
