Lead Solutions Architect: Responsibilities & High-Level Tasks for a Pharmacy/Prescription Portal
1. Core Responsibilities
1.1. Strategic Ownership
- Define solution architecture vision aligned with enterprise strategy, product roadmap, and regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, PCI, SOC2).
- Serve as technical point of contact for pharmacy/prescription systems across lines of business (Commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, IFP, Voluntary).
2. Architecture Development
2.1. Design end-to-end solution architectures integrating:
- Rx claims processing, prior auth, formulary, drug pricing (NDC, RxNorm)
- PBM integrations (e.g., Caremark, OptumRx)
- Eligibility, benefits, and member services APIs
- Digital front-ends (web, mobile, SuperApp)
- AI/ML models (e.g., prescription adherence, fraud detection)
2.2. Define API strategy (REST, GraphQL, FHIR, HL7) for portal backend services.
2.3. Define data flows, event models, and streaming patterns (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis).
3. Alignment & Governance
3.1. Enforce enterprise architecture standards (security, compliance, cloud patterns).
3.2. Align pharmacy solution design with enterprise architecture guardrails.
3.3. Ensure data governance: PHI/PII handling, audit trails, metadata standards.
3.4. Drive cloud architecture best practices (AWS/Azure services, serverless, containers).
4. Key High-Level Tasks
4.1. Technical Leadership
- Build and document current-state and target-state architectures (logical, physical, data, network, security).
- Define non-functional requirements (NFRs): availability, scalability, latency, cost, observability.
- Lead architecture review boards and design reviews for pharmacy solutions.
- Design authentication/authorization flows (OAuth2, Cognito, Okta, custom SSO).
- Guide multi-cloud, hybrid, or on-prem considerations for pharmacy services.
4.2. Delivery Acceleration
- Define and enforce CI/CD pipelines, DevSecOps patterns, IaC templates (e.g., Terraform, CDK).
- Identify reusable architecture components (e.g., API gateways, event bridges).
- Drive observability architecture: logs, metrics, tracing for pharmacy services.
- Define SLAs/SLOs for critical pharmacy APIs and workflows.
- Define data migration, cutover, and rollback strategies for new pharmacy capabilities.
4.3. Stakeholder Engagement
- Collaborate with product managers to shape backlog priorities and align technical feasibility.
- Engage with security and compliance teams on HIPAA, HITRUST, NIST 800-53.
- Partner with data teams for Rx data pipelines, AI/ML integrations, and reporting.
- Drive vendor evaluation and selection (e.g., PBMs, specialty pharmacies, drug databases).
- Communicate architecture trade-offs clearly to leadership and business stakeholders.
5. Key Questions
5.1. What guardrails and design authorities exist for pharmacy system architectures?
5.2. How are cloud-native principles (e.g., serverless, microservices) balanced against legacy system realities?
5.3. Are there mandates for specific frameworks (e.g., FHIR, HL7 for interoperability)?
5.4. What is the policy on vendor-managed services vs. in-house solutions for core pharmacy flows?
5.5 What is the governance process for introducing new APIs, data models, or event streams?
5.6. How are security, compliance, and audit requirements reviewed and signed off for pharmacy APIs?
5.7 What is the process for gaining leadership buy-in on new architectural patterns?
5.8. How do we measure success metrics (e.g., availability, latency, error rates) for pharmacy services?
